Advantages of using Builder method:
Reusability: While making the various representations of the products, we can use the same construction code for other representations as well.
Single Responsibility Principle: We can separate out both the business logic as well as the complex construction code from each other.
Construction of the object: Here we construct our object step by step, defer construction steps or run steps recursively.
Disadvantages of using Builder method:
Code complexity increases: The complexity of our code increases, because the builder pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
Mutability: It requires the builder class to be mutable
Initialization: Data members of the class are not guaranteed to be initialized.
