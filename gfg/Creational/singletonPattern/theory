Singleton Method is a type of Creational Design pattern and is one of the simplest design pattern available to us. It is a way to provide one and only one object of a particular type. It involves only one class to create methods and specify the objects. 
Singleton Design Pattern can be understood by a very simple example of Database connectivity. When each object creates a unique Database Connection to the Database, it will highly affect the cost and expenses of the project. So, it is always better to make a single connection rather than making extra irrelevant connections which can be easily done by Singleton Design Pattern.
